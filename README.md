| 19 | Given an N by K matrix where the nth row and kth column represents the cost to build the nth house with kth color, return the minimum cost which achieves this goal. | [Day 19](../master/day_19.py) |
| 20 | Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the intersecting node. The lists are non-cyclical. | [Day 20](../master/day_20.py) |
| 21 | Given an array of time intervals (start, end) for classroom lectures (possibly overlapping). | [Day 21](../master/day_21.py) |
| 22 | Given a dictionary of words and a string made up of those words (no spaces), return the original sentence in a list. | [Day 22](../master/day_22.py) |
| 23 | You are given an M by N matrix consisting of booleans that represents a board. Each True boolean represents a wall. Each False boolean represents a tile you can walk on. | [Day 23](../master/day_23.py) |
| 24 | Implement locking in a binary tree. A binary tree node can be locked or unlocked only if all of its descendants or ancestors are not locked. | [Day 24](../master/day_24.py) |
| 25 | Implement regular expression matching with the following special characters: | [Day 25](../master/day_25.py) |
