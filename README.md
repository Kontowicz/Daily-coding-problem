|-----|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k. For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17. | [Day 1](../master/day_01.py)|
| 2 | Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i. | [Day 2](../master/day_02.py) || 2 | Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i. | [Day 2](../master/day_02.py) || 2 | Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i. | [Day 2](../master/day_02.py) |
| 3 | Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a string, and deserialize(s) | [Day 3](../master/day_03.py) |
| 4 | Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. | [Day 4](../master/day_04.py) |
| 5 | cons(a, b) constructs a pair, and car(pair) and cdr(pair) returns the first and last element of that pair. | [Day 5](../master/day_05.py) |
| 7 | Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded. | [Day 7](../master/day_07.py) |
| 8 | A unival tree (which stands for "universal value") is a tree where all nodes under it have the same value. | [Day 8](../master/day_08.py) |
| 9 | Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative. | [Day 9](../master/day_09.py) |
| 10 | Implement a job scheduler which takes in a function f and an integer n, and calls f after n milliseconds. | [Day 10](../master/day_10.py) |
