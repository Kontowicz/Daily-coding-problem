| 1 | Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k. For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17. | [Day 1](../master/day_01.py)|
| 2 | Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i. | [Day 2](../master.day_02.py) || 2 | Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i. | [Day 2](../master.day_02.py) || 2 | Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i. | [Day 2](../master.day_02.py) |
| 3 | Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a string, and deserialize(s) | [Day 3](../master.day_03.py) |
| 4 | Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. | [Day 4](../master.day_04.py) |
| 5 | cons(a, b) constructs a pair, and car(pair) and cdr(pair) returns the first and last element of that pair. | [Day 5](../master.day_05.py) |
